#Allows for custom number of questions and will give user a score on a scale of 0-100.

#Requirements
#------------
#1) Take user input for one of 4 categories to choose from : Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
#2) Allow user input for custom number of problems
#3) Build functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic
#4) Provide generation for random set of numbers between a set interval
#5) Build function for displaying correct or incorrect answer to user
#6) Keep track of correct/incorrect answers to provide user with a score

#Imports the methods from a seperate file named 'mathFunctions', seperating the code helps keep it clean and more readable
import mathFunctions as mf

mf.MathTest()
